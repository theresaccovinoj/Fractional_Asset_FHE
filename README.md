# Fractional Asset FHE: A Game Asset Co-ownership Platform 🎮💰

Fractional Asset FHE is an innovative platform designed for the fractional ownership of gaming assets, powered by **Zama's Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) technology**. This groundbreaking solution allows multiple players to collaboratively invest in expensive game assets while ensuring their identities and investment proportions remain confidential and secure through FHE encryption. 

## Pain Point

The gaming community often faces challenges when accessing expensive in-game assets. High-value items can create a substantial barrier for ordinary gamers who wish to invest. Current models often lack transparency and security, leading to concerns over privacy and misuse of player information. Traditional fractional ownership platforms fail to protect the privacy of co-owners, leaving them vulnerable to exposure.

## The FHE Solution

By leveraging **Zama’s Fully Homomorphic Encryption technology**, Fractional Asset FHE addresses these issues head-on. Zama's open-source libraries, such as **Concrete**, **TFHE-rs**, and the **zama-fhe SDK**, enable the secure handling of sensitive data, allowing for the verification of ownership shares and transaction executions without revealing any private information. This means that players can confidently co-invest in valuable game assets without compromising their privacy or security.

## Key Features

- 🔒 **FHE Encrypted Ownership Shares:** Protects the identity of co-owners and their investment percentages using state-of-the-art encryption.
- 🤝 **Homomorphic Execution for Usage Rights Distribution:** Enables secure and private distribution of asset usage rights and profit-sharing through homomorphic execution.
- 💡 **Participation in High-End Assets for All Players:** Facilitates ordinary gamers' participation in high-value asset investments, democratizing access in the gaming realm.
- 📈 **Financial Collaboration in Gaming:** Encourages cooperative financial involvement and strategizing among players, fostering a vibrant economy in the gaming ecosystem.
- 🛠️ **Asset Management Dashboard:** A user-friendly interface to manage contributions, shares, and asset revenues seamlessly.

## Technology Stack

- **Zama FHE SDK**: Core component for ensuring confidential computations.
- **Solidity**: Smart contract language for Ethereum blockchain.
- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime for building scalable network applications.
- **Hardhat/Foundry**: Frameworks for Ethereum development, testing, and deployment.
- **React**: Library for building interactive user interfaces.
- **Web3.js**: JavaScript library for interacting with the Ethereum blockchain.

## Installation Guide

To set up the project, follow these steps (make sure you have Node.js installed):

1. Open your terminal and navigate to the project directory.
2. Run the following command to install the necessary dependencies, including Zama FHE libraries:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

**Please refrain from using `git clone` or any URLs. This is a standalone installation process.**

## Build & Run Guide

Once you have installed the project dependencies, you can compile, test, and run the project using the following commands:

- To compile the smart contracts, run:

  ```bash
  npx hardhat compile
  ```

- To run the test suite, execute:

  ```bash
  npx hardhat test
  ```

- To deploy the contracts to a network, execute:

  ```bash
  npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network <your-network>
  ```

## Example Usage

Below is a simple code snippet demonstrating how to create a new fractional asset in your game platform using the smart contract:

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

import "./Fractional_Asset_FHE.sol";

contract AssetManager {
    Fractional_Asset_FHE asset;

    constructor(address _assetAddress) {
        asset = Fractional_Asset_FHE(_assetAddress);
    }

    function createFractionalAsset(string memory assetName, uint256 totalShares) public {
        asset.createAsset(assetName, totalShares);
    }

    function buyShares(uint256 assetId, uint256 shares) public {
        asset.buy(assetId, shares);
    }
}
```

This snippet outlines how to interact with the `Fractional_Asset_FHE` contract to create and manage assets within the gaming environment, democratizing access to valuable in-game resources.
